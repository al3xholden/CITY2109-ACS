CITY2109 - Software Development - Assignment 2
Access Control System by Alexander Holden

I implemented the prototype, however, some of the functions are incomplete. 
This resulted with portions of the application not functioning as intended, if at all. 
However, the prototype was fully planned and documented beforehand, which will allow myself or readers to complete the code in the future. 
I uploaded my project files to a git repository, which made it a lot easier to work on the project in multiple locations. 

In conclusion, I think that this project has been designed to a good standard and the implementation of the prototype could have been improved significantly. 
I believe that the extra layer of security, the login system, is fundamental to a project such as this.
